Spam_mail_Prediction using Support Vector Machine<br>

<b>Problem statement:-</b> Spam mail Prediction using Support Vector Machine.<br>
Now our task is to check whether the given mail is spam or ham(mail which are not spam).<br>
<b>Reads the following steps</b> where we must have to follow these to succesfully accomplish our task.<br>
<b>1. We need to get the text data.</b> The data which is having the both spam and ham mails in it.<br>
<b>2.Data processing:</b> We need to process the data in this step. The model cannot work on text data, so that's why we need to preprocess the data.<br>
<b>3.Feature extraction:</b> Here we convert the text into feature vectors. This is one of the important steps because we need to feed this feature into our model.<br>
<b>4.Train_Test_Split:</b> Now in this step we'll split the data set into train data and test data. Model will be trained on the train data and it will be evaluated on the test data.<br>
<b>5.Support Vector Machine:</b> Now we have to feed our trained data into Support Vector Machine models. The model gets trained based on its data.<br>
6.After this model get trained, we will be <b>feeding this model with new mail.</b> Now this trained model can predict whether this new mail is spam mail or ham mai based its training.<br>
NOTE:Here I've implemented this project using python.
